# Password Manager

Created this Password Manager

This is a desktop application that you can use and save your passwords locally.

This desktop is safe application which is to be used locally in your machine. Therefore, you can look up your saved passwords for a particular website. This is an alternative to Google password manager or other cloud techs where you can save your passwords to. Remember those cloud services knows your password whereas this desktop application your passwords are kept save only for you.

You need to create a file named ``hide.py`` we are just hiding var here no big deal look at ``example_hide.py`` to see what to put inside ``hide.py`. Should have made an ``.env`` file but i think is not a big deal atm.
